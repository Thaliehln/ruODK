# ruODK 0.3.1
## Preparation for ROpenSci presubmission
* Check name with [`available::available("ruODK")`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#naming-your-package):
  * Name valid: ✔
  * Available on CRAN: ✔ 
  * Available on Bioconductor: ✔
  * Available on GitHub:  ✔ 
  * Rude misinterpretations: none
  * In summary: Package name seems to be OK. Well, ODK. OK, ruODK.
* Added metadata via [`codemetar::write_codemeta("ruODK")`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#creating-metadata-for-your-package)
* [Cross-platform](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#platforms): 
  Runs on GNU/Linux (TravisCI) and on Windows (AppVeyor)
* [Function naming](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#function-and-argument-naming)
  follows `object_verb`, trying to balance parity with ODK Central API endpoints
  with consistency, especially when to use plural and singular for `object`.
  Using `snake_case` except where camelCase inherited from API objects.
  Exception: functions operating on the OData endpoints are named `get_*`. These
  will be renamed `odata_<object>_<verb>`.
* [Code style](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#code-style) done
  by `styler::style_package()`, see section "Release" in `README.md`.
* ruODK [has a `README.Rmd`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#readme) 
  and has a [website generated by `pkgdown`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#website).
* ruODK has documentation [generated by `roxygen2`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#documentation).
* [Testing](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#testing): test coverage
  above 75%. 
* Spellchecks with `spelling::spell_check_package()`: added technical terms and
  function names to `inst/WORDLIST`.

## TODO
* Add [examples](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#examples) to docs.


# ruODK 0.3.0
* Use tidyverse issue template
* Follow `goodpractice`
* Created vignette "Setup"
* Add AppVeyor
* Refactor storage path of attachments to not contain "uuid:" (for Windows compat)
* Started on REST API: `project_list`, `project_detail`, `form_list`, 
  `form_detail`. Naming scheme is `object_verb`. 
* For now, functions related to the OData endpoint
  are named `verb_object`, maybe we should rename them to `odata_object_verb`.
* Refactor URLs - build from project and form IDs
  
# ruODK 0.2.4
* Cleaned up logo, thanks to @issa-tseng for suggestions

# ruODK 0.2.3
* Added a new form, Flora Quadrat 0.3 to inst/extdata.

# ruODK 0.2.2
* Added more test coverage.

# ruODK 0.2.1
* Added various `usethis` goodies, test stubs, badges.

# ruODK 0.2.0
* Recursively unnests raw data into wide format. Manual post-processing is still
  required to rename (anonymous in ODK and auto-named through R) coordinates,
  and to handle attachments.

# ruODK 0.1.0
* Parses metadata, submissions, 
  and handles attachments (retaining already downloaded attachments).
* Includes example forms as both `.xml` and `.odbbuild` in `inst/extdata`.
* Includes example data as retrieved from ODK Central.
* Includes vignette demonstrating tidying of retrieved data.
* Handles repeating groups.

Roadmap:

* Handle paginated submissions.
* Retain already downloaded submissions.
