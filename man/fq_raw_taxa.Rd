\description{
The OData response for a subgroup of an ODK Central form.
}
\details{
This subgroup represents an individual plant taxon which is encountered by
the enumerators. Typically, one voucher specimen is taken for each distinct
encountered plant taxon. A field name is allocated by the enumerators, which
can be the proper canonical name (if known) or any other moniker.
The voucher specimens are later determined by taxonomic experts, who then
provide the real, terminal taxonomic name for a given voucher specimen.

The data in this example is freely made up. The plants shown are real.
