Especially in these trying times, it is important to ask: "ruODK?"

[OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/) (ODK) is a free and open-source software 
for collecting, managing, and using data in resource-constrained environments.

ODK consists of a range of [software packages and apps](https://opendatakit.org/software/).
`ruODK` assumes some familiarity of its users with the ODK ecosystem and workflows.
For a detailed overview, read the extensive [ODK documentation](https://docs.opendatakit.org/)
and visit the friendly [ODK forum](https://forum.opendatakit.org/).

[ODK Central](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-intro/) is a cloud-based
data clearinghouse for digitally captured data, replacing the older software 
[ODK Aggregate](https://docs.opendatakit.org/aggregate-intro/). 
ODK Central manages user accounts and permissions, stores form definitions, 
and allows data collection clients like 
[ODK Collect](https://docs.opendatakit.org/collect-intro/) to connect to it for 
form download and submission upload.

A typical [ODK workflow](https://docs.opendatakit.org/#how-is-odk-used):
After data have been captured digitally using ODK Collect, the data are uploaded
and stored in ODK Central. The next step from there is to extract the data, 
optionally upload it into another data warehouse, and then to analyse and 
generate insight from it. 

While data can be retrieved in bulk through the GUI, ODK Central's API provides 
access to its data and functionality through both an OData and a RESTful API 
with a comprehensive and interactive 
[documentation](https://odkcentral.docs.apiary.io/#reference/odata-endpoints).

`ruODK` is aimed at the technically minded researcher who wishes to access and
use the data from ODK Central using the programming language R.

`ruODK`'s scope:

* To wrap all ODK Central API endpoints with a focus on **data access**.
* To provide working examples of interacting with the ODK Central API.
* To provide convenience helpers for the day to day tasks when working with 
  ODK Central data in R: **data munging** the ODK Central API output into tidy 
  R formats.
  
`ruODK`'s use cases:

* Smaller projects:
  1. Data collection: ODK Collect
  2. Data clearinghouse: ODK Central
  3. Data analysis and reporting: `Rmd` (ruODK)
  4. Publishing and dissemination: [`ckanr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/ckanr/), 
     [`CKAN`](https://ckan.org/)
     
* Larger projects:
  1. Data collection: ODK Collect
  2. Data clearinghouse: ODK Central
  3. ETL pipeline into data warehouses: `Rmd` (ruODK)
  4. QA: in data warehouse
  5. Reporting: `Rmd`
  6. Publishing and dissemination: [`ckanr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/ckanr/),
     [`CKAN`](https://ckan.org/)
  
Out of scope:

* To wrap "management" API endpoints. The ODK Central GUI provides a comprehensive 
  interface for the management of users, roles, permissions, projects, and forms.
  Behind the scenes, it is a 
  [VueJS application](https://github.com/opendatakit/central-frontend/) 
  working on the "management" API endpoints of the ODK Central backend.
* To provide extensive data visualisation. We show only minimal examples of data 
  visualisation and presentation, mainly to illustrate the example data.
  Once the data is in your hands as tidy tibbles... u r ODK!

## Install

You can install ruODK from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("dbca-wa/ruODK", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## ODK Central
### Access to an ODK Central instance
First, we need an ODK Central instance and some data to play with!

Either ask in the [ODK forum] for an account in the 
[ODK Central Sandbox](https://sandbox.central.opendatakit.org/),
or follow the [setup instructions](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-intro/)
to build and deploy your very own ODK Central instance.

### ODK Central setup
The ODK Central [user manual](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-using/) 
provides up-to-date descriptions of the steps below.

* [Create a web user account](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-users/#creating-a-web-user) 
  on an ODK Central instance. Your username will be an email address.
* [Create a project](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-projects/) and give the
  web user the relevant permissions.
* Create an Xform, e.g. using ODK Build, or use the provided example forms.
* [Publish the form](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-forms/) to ODK Central.
* Collect some data for this form on ODK Collect and let ODK Collect submit the
  finalised forms to ODK Central.

A note on the [included example forms](https://github.com/dbca-wa/ruODK/tree/master/inst/extdata): 
The `.odkbuild` versions can be loaded into [ODK Build](https://build.opendatakit.org/), 
while the `.xml` versions can be imported into ODK Central.

## Configure ruODK
For a quick start, create R environment variables with your ODK Central credentials:
  
```{r rprofile, eval=F}
Sys.setenv(ODKC_URL = "https://odkcentral.mydomain.com")
Sys.setenv(ODKC_UN = "me@mail.com")
Sys.setenv(ODKC_PW = ".......")
```

For all available detailed options to configure `ruODK`, read 
`vignette("Setup", package = "ruODK")` 
(online [here](https://dbca-wa.github.io/ruODK/articles/setup.html)).

## Use ruODK

A quick example using the OData service:

```{r odata_example, eval=T, message=FALSE}
library(ruODK)

# Download from ODK Central
proj <- ruODK::project_list()
proj

meta <- ruODK::odata_metadata_get(
  pid = 1,
  fid = "build_Turtle-Sighting-0-1_1559790020"
)
# listviewer::jsonedit(meta)
meta$Edmx$DataServices$Schema

data <- ruODK::odata_submission_get(
  pid = 1,
  fid = "build_Turtle-Sighting-0-1_1559790020"
) %>%
  ruODK::odata_submission_parse()
data %>% head(.)
```

A more detailed walk-through with some data visualisation examples is available
in the `vignette("odata", package="ruODK")` 
(online [here](https://dbca-wa.github.io/ruODK/articles/odata.html)).

See also `vignette("restapi", package="ruODK")` 
(online [here](https://dbca-wa.github.io/ruODK/articles/api.html))
for examples using the alternative RESTful API.
