# ruODK: An ODK Central OData client <img src="man/figures/ruODK.png" align="right" alt="Are you ODK?" width="120" />

Especially in these trying times, it is important to ask: "R U ODK?"

ODK Central provides data through an OData API, which has a comprehensive and 
interactive [documentation](https://odkcentral.docs.apiary.io/#reference/odata-endpoints).

This package aims to provide an automatable, reproducible way to retrieve data
from ODK Central's OData API in the R ecosystem.

## Installation

You can install ruODK from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dbca-wa/ruODK")
```

## Use

### Set up ODK Central
First, we need some data to play with!

The ODK Central [user manual](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-using/) 
provides up-to-date descriptions of the steps below.

* [Create a web user account](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-users/#creating-a-web-user) 
  on an ODK Central instance. Your username will be an email address.
* Create a [project](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-projects/) and give the
  web user the relevant permissions.
* Create a Xform, e.g. using ODK Build, or use the provided example forms.
* Publish the [form to ODK Central](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-forms/).
* Collect some data for this form on ODK Collect and let ODK Collect submit the
  finalised forms to ODK Central.
* Get the ODK Central OData service URL for the form.

A note on the [included example forms](https://github.com/dbca-wa/ruODK/tree/master/inst/extdata): 
The `.odkbuild` versions can be loaded into [ODK Build](https://build.opendatakit.org/), 
while the `.xml` versions can be imported into ODK Central.

### Configure ruODK
For now, ODK Central supports BasicAuth (username and password).

We could supply those credentials to each `ruODK` function call, but that's
cumbersome and not securely reproducible (the command would include the sensitive 
credentials).

A better way is to set your ODK Central username (email) and password as 
R environment variables, e.g. in your `~/.Rprofile` (to set them per machine),
or in a separate file (to set them per project).

`ruODK` functions default to use the R environment variables `ODKC_UN` and `ODKC_PW`
for authentication.
  
```{r, eval=F}
Sys.setenv(ODKC_UN="...@...")
Sys.setenv(ODKC_PW=".......")
```

### Use ruODK

ruODK aims to provide the same access to your submissions via ODK Central's 
OData service endpoints as MS Excel, MS PowerBI and Tableau.

At the end of this step, we want to achieve the same outcome as the [manual
download to CSV](https://docs.opendatakit.org/central-submissions/#downloading-submissions-as-csvs).

A quick example:

```{r, eval=F}
library(ruODK)

# ODK Central credentials
if (file.exists("~/.Rprofile")) source("~/.Rprofile")

# ODK Central OData service URL
data_url <- "https://sandbox.central.opendatakit.org/v1/projects/14/forms/build_Flora-Quadrat-0-2_1558575936.svc"

# Download from ODK Central
meta <- data_url %>% get_metadata()
data <- data_url %>% get_submissions() %>% parse_submissions()
```

A more detailed walk-through with some data visualisation examples is available
in the `vignette("example")` or 
[here](https://dbca-wa.github.io/ruODK/articles/example.html).
